# NUS Student Information Dashboard - Your one-stop-shop for all information

### Introduction

![](readme_images/frontpage.png)


This application was inspired by a problem faced by many NUS students durind the COVID pandemic in 2020. NUS was pushing out multiple announcements and measures weekly - all of this was mainly done via a PDF emailed to all students. Information differed across the weeks, with different zones experiencing different instructions. 

The second problem we aim to tackle is the complete virtualness of this semester, resulting in everyone spending their entire lives in front of their computer, be it for lessons, for work, for meals, for socialising (virtually), or even just netflix.

The lack of a centralised repository of information and blurred control of our time inspired this project. As such, we decided to develop an application to solve this problem. 

We hope that you will enjoy using this :bowtie:
